# STM32 Self-Balancing Controller Example

This folder contains a minimal example implementation of a self-balancing control algorithm for the STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller. The code demonstrates how sliding mode control with basic adaptive features can be integrated with an IMU to stabilize a vehicle at a desired pitch angle.

The code assumes the use of STM32Cube HAL libraries and a generic I2C IMU driver. Functions should be adapted to match your specific hardware setup and HAL configuration.
